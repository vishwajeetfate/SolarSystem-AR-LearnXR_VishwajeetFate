# 🌍 Solar System AR — LearnXR STEM Module Submission

## 📌 Topic Chosen: The Solar System

We selected the **Solar System** as our STEM topic because:
- It's foundational to both space science and general astronomy
- It provides clear structure and order (planetary orbits, names, distances)
- It allows for highly visual, interactive, and immersive learning — ideal for AR

## 🎓 Learning Experience Flow

1. **Start Lesson**  
   User taps “Start Lesson” to begin the guided experience.

2. **Image Tracking Activation**  
   The app waits for a tracked image (e.g., printed Sun marker). Once detected, the Solar System appears.

3. **Planet Zoom-In + Info Panel**  
   The camera zooms into the first planet (Mercury) and shows:
   - Planet name and description
   - A 2D planet image
   - Audio narration
   - Option to rotate the planet (touch/mouse)

4. **Step-by-Step Navigation**  
   Users press “Next” to explore the next planet in order.

5. **Interactive Rotation**  
   Users can drag to rotate the 3D planet models in AR.
